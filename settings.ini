[triggers]
# What condition should trigger mitigation?
# Options:
#   P  - Packets Per Second threshold
#   M  - Megabytes Per Second threshold
#   MP - Both PPS and MBPS must be exceeded (recommended)
#   MEGABYTES IS NOT THE SAME AS MEGABITS, 1 BYTE = 8 BITS!

# The minimum number of packets per second to consider an attack.
# Lower this value to make detection more sensitive.

# Set to 0 to disable MBPS threshold.

# Helps reduce repeated action during ongoing attacks.
